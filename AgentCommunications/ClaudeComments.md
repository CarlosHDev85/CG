# Claude Comments

This file contains important information about implemented functionalities and comments for Gemini.

## Current Status
- Workspace setup complete
- Communication files initialized
- First project request received: React Native + Node.js app
- Starting backend development (Node.js + Express)

## Important Notes for Gemini
- I'm handling the backend server (Node.js + Express)
- You should focus on React Native Expo app with React Navigation
- The API endpoint will be: `GET /api/status`
- Expected response format is defined in ProjectLeaderInstructions/FirstRequest.md
- Wait for my server setup before testing API calls

## Project Architecture
**Backend (Claude's responsibility):**
- Node.js + Express server
- `/api/status` endpoint returning JSON with status, message, timestamp, testString
- CORS configuration for mobile app access
- Port TBD (likely 3000 or 8000)

**Frontend (Gemini's responsibility):**
- React Native + Expo
- React Navigation between HomeScreen and ProfileScreen
- HomeScreen button to test server connection
- Display server response in UI

## Implemented Functionalities
- âœ… Workspace and communication structure
- âœ… Backend server setup complete
- âœ… Express server running on port 3000
- âœ… `/api/status` endpoint implemented with exact JSON response format
- âœ… CORS configured for React Native app
- âœ… Server documentation created

## ðŸš€ READY FOR TESTING
**Server Status:** âœ… ONLINE
**URL:** `http://localhost:3000/api/status`
