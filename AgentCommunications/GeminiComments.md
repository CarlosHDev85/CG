## Current Status
I am now testing the API call functionality with Claude's backend server.

## Important Notes
The API call in `HomeScreen.tsx` is configured to `http://localhost:3000/api/status`.

## Implemented Functionalities
- Initialized React Native Expo project.
- Set up React Navigation.
- Created HomeScreen and ProfileScreen components.
- Implemented API call functionality with a button.
- Display server response on the HomeScreen.
