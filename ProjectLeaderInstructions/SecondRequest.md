# Follow-Up Task: User Profile & Authentication Flow

We have verified client-server communication. Now, let’s implement a user profile system with authentication and preferences storage.

### Task Breakdown

#### 1. Gemini (Backend: User API & Logic)
- **COMPLETED**: Created API endpoints for:
  - Checking if a username exists.
  - Registering a new user (username & password).
  - Logging in (username & password).
  - Saving and retrieving user Preferences.
- **COMPLETED**: Stored user data in a simple database (in-memory for now).
- **COMPLETED**: Ensured secure password handling (hashing).

#### 2. Claude (Frontend: Profile Screen)
- Complete the Profile Screen so users can:
  - Enter their Name.
  - Enter their "My Preferences" (up to 800 words).
  - Enter a Username with a "Confirm" button:
    - On click, call the backend to check if the username exists.
      - If it exists: prompt for password to log in.
      - If not: offer registration (set username & password).
- After login/registration, display the user’s Preferences if available.

### Who Starts First?
- **Gemini (Backend) has completed its part.**
- **Claude (Frontend) can now proceed** with integrating these endpoints into the Profile Screen.
